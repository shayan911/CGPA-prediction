# CGPA-prediction
This project consists of multiple Machine Learning models on student grades to predict CGPA of students , multiple models are created for multiple assumptions.

The notebook uploaded here is also uploaded on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ssshayan/multiple-regression)

The workflow is self explanatory and comments are provided where necessary.
A series of models created are as follows:

Machine Learning models  | Accuracy
------------- | -------------
 Linear Regression   | 96.34 %
 Decision Tree  | 91.49 %
 KNN  | 84.39 %
 SVM | 94.53 % 
 GPR |  85.73 %



**The dataset(owned) is public on my [kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssshayan/grades-of-students)**
