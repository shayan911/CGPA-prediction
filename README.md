# CGPA-prediction
CGPA-prediction is a data science project work consisting of multiple Machine Learning models on student grades to predict CGPA of students , multiple models are created for multiple assumptions to predict CGPA

The notebook uploaded here is also uploaded on kaggle.
You can view it and find the feedback of veterans of kaggle[CGPA-prediction.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ssshayan/multiple-regression)

The workflow of predicting CGPA is self explanatory and comments are provided where necessary.
A series of models created to acheive the objective of predicting CGPA are as follows:

Machine Learning models  | Accuracy
------------- | -------------
 Linear Regression   | 96.34 %
 Decision Tree  | 91.49 %
 KNN  | 84.39 %
 SVM | 94.53 % 
 GPR |  85.73 %

**The dataset [CGPA prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssshayan/grades-of-students)  is open-for-all to accomodate learning and research work**
